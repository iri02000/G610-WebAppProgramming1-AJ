	<p>Future lawyer and lifelong humanitarian. I’m a second-year student at Yale with dreams of attending Yale Law after I graduate. While others may want to handle flashy cases that make the news, I want to help people who haven’t been given their fair chance in society.

			My experience in public interest law firms has brought my attention to cases involving employment discrimination and civil rights violations. Last summer, I finished a legal internship at the Connecticut Fair Housing Center, which taught me the importance of advocating for my client against all odds.
			
			I plan to graduate with a double major in political science and psychology. These concentrations have provided invaluable insight into the civil rights, constitutional, and humanitarian crises in today’s world. I hope that my philosophy and skills will lead to a greater sense of social equality.</p>
